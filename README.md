# dashas-website
Hi there, I'm Dasha and this is my first personal website.

After considering various ways of putting together a programming portfolio, I decided to go with a HTML5 + CSS website, as it the most organized and visually appealing way of creating this product. The website is developed mostly using flexbox layouts. 

It showcases my projects, education, and interests. Feel free to check it out! :D

In the future, I am going to add JavaScrips elements to this code.
